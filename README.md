# COS143-StockTracker
This is a small project made for my web-design course. It can display stock data with charts and tables, with a pseudo-function of adding to portfolio.
The master branch will require a login before being able to use the stock functionality.
For checking out the stock functionalities, simply run A8.html under "portfolio" branch.
